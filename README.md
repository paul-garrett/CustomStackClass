# Custom Stack Class

### Write the Java code to create a generic Stack class that can hold any type of object.

### Use an ArrayList implementation of a stack.

![Stack Operations](StackOperations.png)

# Include the following operations:
- ### size() should return the number of items in the stack.
- ### isEmpty() should return true/false if the stack contains no items.
- ### top() should return, but not remove the top element of the stack.
- ### push(E) should attempt to push the element in parenthesis onto the stack.
- ### pop() should remove and return the top element of the stack.

# Writing and Testing Your Code

### Write a little at a time and test it before moving on to the next part

### Constructor first - You need to be able to construct the stack object in your main method first.

### One method at a time - Write a method and then test it before writing the other methods.

### Which method is the simplest to test? Write that one first.

### Slowly build the class one peice at a time and it will be much easier to test and debug.
